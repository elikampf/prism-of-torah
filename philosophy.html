                            <p>Seven years ago, I was visiting family in Toronto, catching up with close childhood friends over sushi and smooth scotch. I shared a Torah thought that felt meaningful to me, and honestly, I was just hoping it would resonate with them too.</p>
                            
                            <p>After I finished, one friend said something that changed everything: "You should do this every week. Send us audio clips we can listen to while commuting."</p>
                            
                            <p>That casual suggestion—born from friendship and good food—became the seed for everything you see here. Sometimes the most meaningful journeys start in the most ordinary moments.</p>

                                <p>I'm Asaf Aharon Prisman, and I live in <span class="location-tag">Ramat Beit Shemesh</span> with my family. My Torah journey began at Yeshivat Or Chaim in Toronto under Rabbi Avishai David, then continued at Yeshivat Birkat Moshe and Netivot Olam in Israel, where I learned from luminaries like Rabbi Yosef Bruk and Rabbi Nachum Diamant.</p>
                                
                                <p>Through years of intensive learning, I developed "Bederech Ha'avodah" – The Path of Service. This approach transforms abstract Torah concepts into practical tools for personal growth and Avodas Hashem.</p>
                                
                                <p>Today, I learn in Kollel Beis Hillel, teach daily Daf Yomi, and engage in one-on-one learning sessions. I'm also the voice behind the "Prism of Torah" podcast, sharing weekly insights that make Torah wisdom "Shaveh l'kol nefesh" – equally valuable to every soul.</p>
                                
                                <p>At the heart of my work is a deep commitment to Klal Yisrael's spiritual growth. I believe that by making Torah accessible, engaging, and relevant, we can foster renewed purpose, connection, and Jewish pride in every individual.</p>

                    <p>We live in a time when everything feels fragmented. Work life, family life, spiritual life—all in separate boxes. But Torah offers something different: a unified framework where everything connects, where ancient wisdom speaks directly to modern challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether you have five minutes or five hours, whether you're just starting your journey or you've been learning for years, there's something here for you. Because that's how Torah works: infinite depth, accessible entry points, and always room to grow.</p>
