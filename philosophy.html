                    <p>Seven years ago, I was visiting family in Toronto, catching up with close childhood friends over sushi and smooth scotch. I shared a Torah thought that felt meaningful to me, and honestly, I was just hoping it would resonate with them too.</p>
                    
                    <p>After I finished, one friend said something that changed everything: "You should do this every week. Send us audio clips we can listen to while commuting."</p>
                    
                    <p>That casual suggestion—born from friendship and good food—became the seed for everything you see here. Sometimes the most meaningful journeys start in the most ordinary moments.</p>

                    <p>I'm Asaf Aharon Prisman, and I live in Ramat Beit Shemesh with my family. I learn at Kollel Beis Hillel, teach a daily Daf Yomi shiur, and spend my days thinking about how to make Torah wisdom accessible to people living real, busy lives.</p>
                    
                    <p>My path took me from Toronto to yeshivos in Israel—Birkat Moshe in Maaleh Adumim and Netivot Olam in Bnei Brak—where I developed my approach to learning. But the real education happened when I realized that all that depth means nothing if it doesn't connect to how people actually live.</p>

                    <p>The Hebrew title of my work is "Shomer HaPardes"—from the verse in Nechemiah where Asaf was the keeper of the king's orchard. Someone who cultivated and protected precious growing things.</p>
                    
                    <p>The English title, "Prism of Torah," plays on my surname but captures something deeper. Just as a prism reveals the full spectrum of light hidden in a single ray, Torah learning should reveal infinite depth in every verse, every concept, every life situation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Torah isn't meant to be compartmentalized into "religious time." It's meant to be the lens through which everything else makes sense—your relationships, your challenges, your daily decisions, your biggest dreams.</p>

                    <p>The goal isn't to become someone else. It's to become more yourself—the version of yourself that Torah was always meant to help you discover.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether you have five minutes or five hours, whether you're just starting your journey or you've been learning for years, there's something here for you. Because that's how Torah works: infinite depth, accessible entry points, and always room to grow.</p>
